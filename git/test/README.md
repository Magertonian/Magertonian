* Part 3
	* Source Code Control System (SCCS)
	* Revision Control System (RCS)
	* Distributed Revision Control System (DRCS)
* Part 4
	* The Distributed Revision Control System between the 3 historical is the best out of three due to the P2P system, essentially decentralizing the code from a main server, so collaboration is faster between systems, and if there is a system failure, other systems can still continue to work.
* Part 5
	* a. This command is used to take content from a remote repository and update the local repository to reflect changes in real time.
	* b. This command is used to display the state of the working directory and staging area.
	* c. This command allows for the staging of individual or all files in the project directory at one time.
 	* d. This command essentially takes a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. The -m"latest build" simply is a message along side the snapshot saying that said snapshot is the latest build.
  	* e. This command uploads local repository content to a remote compository. the --all suffix makes it so that all branches are pushed to the remote compository.
